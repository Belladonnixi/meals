# Meals

## Not my UI or UserFlows!! But I'll fix the one or other part

A in original project of an Udemy course to get riverpod praxis but I did change the data implementation and corrected the inconsistent use of providers.
In the original no mockdatabase implementation existed also not existing was the following providers:
- categories
- meal navigation
- navigation

widgets that didn't exist in the original:
- fliter switch tile
- drawer list tile
- bottom nav bar

lots of methods stayed in original in the widgets, that didn't felt right so I've corrected all of this.

The actual state ofe the project isn't finalized it's the state before animations moving in.
